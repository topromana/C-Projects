# C-Projects

This repository contains projects in which we implement the following data structures and fundamental algorithms were implemented as efficiently as possible: hash tables, heaps, heapify, quicksort, selection sort, breadth first search and depth first search.


For each of the projects I have created a little simulation where the algorithms are run on a wide range of randomly picked input data, and so we can observe the results in the best case, the worst case and the average case.
